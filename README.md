# CS 255 Reflection

1. Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

Our client, DriverPass, came to us wanting an application that allows their students schedule driving tests, purchase driving packages, and take online practice tests. 

2. What did you do particularly well?

I think I did a good job determining the requirements for the system and designing the UML diagrams.

3. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could revise one of my previous documents, I would revise the System Design Requirements. Specifically, I would revise my class model as I feel there could be more. I designed it with a high level view based on the general use case system diagram, but it could have been more detailed.

4. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I considered what the user's needs were and broke them down into user stories to better understand how to implement them. Considering user's needs is important because at the end they are the paying customers. If they don't like the final product, they are less likely to do business with us in the future.

5. How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

Before jumping into software design, it's important to make sure that the requirements have been properly gathered. They are the whole foundation for the system.
